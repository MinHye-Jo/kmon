              Our NFTs are designed to purchase NFTs that are finally sold only after continuing to purchase by series.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our goal is to make short animations.
              <br />
              <br />
              The characters of these NFTs appear.
              <br />
              <br />
              The final NFT buyer of the series is embodied as a character in the anime.
              <br />
              <br />
              Please remember our goals.
